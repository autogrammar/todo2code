# Participant: codex (AI agent)

## Understanding

The user wants `new-project` to control the operating logic of both humans and
agents rather than merely describe it. A multi-step change must have auditable
intent, bounded scope and acceptance criteria in a target-repository ticket
before implementation. Once a ticket is complete, the next change receives the
next ticket number. Follow-up work reuses an unfinished ticket. Human-owned
participant files remain outside agent control.

The enforcement model needs layered trust: fast local feedback, deterministic
CI policy checks, stack-specific verification and repository rules that prevent
merging around those checks. `todo2code` can compare declared intent with the
actual diff, but offline deterministic output—not an LLM response—must decide
the required gate.

Current verified baseline:

- Docker CLI and engine are available; engine version reported `29.1.3`.
- `ticket-017` is `DONE`, so `project/new-ticket.sh` correctly created
  `ticket-018` in `PLAN / WAIT_FOR_APPROVAL`.
- the copied ticket scripts in `todo2code` match the Governance Hub by SHA-256,
  but are not yet published in the current HEAD;
- the current `todo2code` CI tests the application and optional live provider,
  but has no governance job and no persistent `AGENTS.md`;
- no trusted human participant identity is available, so ownership remains
  `unresolved:human`.

## Execution plan

1. Stop at the plan-only boundary and obtain explicit human approval.
2. In the Governance Hub, define a versioned JSON contract and JSON Schema,
   stable diagnostic catalog and stack-profile contract without creating any
   ticket/task/log there.
3. Implement a deterministic validator with text, JSON and SARIF reporting;
   validate repository structure, ticket state, actor ownership, approval
   provenance inputs, manifest drift, diff scope, Docker and stack evidence.
4. Add fixture-driven allow/deny tests and a pinned reusable GitHub Actions
   workflow with least-privilege permissions.
5. Replace unsafe governance automation behavior relevant to the gate (unpinned
   host installs, swallowed validator failures) with a reproducible validation
   entry point, while preserving unrelated analysis generators.
6. Adopt the pinned governance contract in `todo2code`: add `.governance/`, a
   persistent `AGENTS.md`, local commands and the required CI integration.
7. Connect deterministic `todo2code` intent-vs-diff analysis as an additional
   gate or evidence producer; keep live LLM checks advisory/opt-in.
8. Run central governance fixtures, target manifest checks, negative probes,
   application verification and Docker E2E. Record raw command output here and
   map every failure to a stable code/remediation.
9. Review path-specific diffs, update acceptance evidence and report uncommitted
   status. Do not commit or push without a separate user request.

## Actual changes

- Created only the plan scaffold for `ticket-018` and updated the project-level
  ticket index/checklist. No implementation, source, test or CI file was
  changed for ticket-018.
- The user explicitly approved ticket-018 in chat after reviewing the plan;
  implementation is now authorized. Merge-time trust remains an external CI
  concern and is not claimed by this record.

## Blockers

- None at implementation start.

## Approval boundary

- Current state: `EDIT` after explicit chat approval.
- Required response from: `unresolved:human`.
- A chat approval authorizes local implementation for this session; merge-time
  trust will still require an external GitHub review/ruleset and must not be
  inferred from agent-written Markdown.
